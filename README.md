# countdownTimer

In this mini-project
i needed to implement a countdown Timer

#procedure 

First I created and index.html file which will be the base, I needed also an image so that I will complete the full design
Then, I had to manage the style, the countdown timer needed to be in an area where we can see it clearly;
And finaly, I had to get the html class names related to the html tag, and fill it with the result of the method countdown.

countdown, will calculate the difference between the current time and the chrismas time (you can change it to whatever date you want)
after getting this time difference, I had to convert every time format to days, hours, mins and seconds using the standard transformation.
